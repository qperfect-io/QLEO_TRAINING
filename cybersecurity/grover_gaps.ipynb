    "## Introduction and context\n",
    "Grover's algorithm is a foundational quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Introduced by Lov Grover in 1996, it efficiently finds a specific item in an unsorted database of size $N$ using only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database, compared to the $O(N)$ queries required by classical algorithms. Grover's algorithm has broad applications, including in cryptography, optimization problems, pattern matching and machine learning and quantum complexity theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard implementation of Grover's algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization: Start with a register of $n$ qubits in the $|0\\rangle$ state, where $N = 2^n$ is the size of the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Superposition: Apply Hadamard gates (H) to all qubits, creating a uniform superposition of all possible states\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grover Iteration: Repeat the following steps $\\sqrt{N}$ times:\n",
    "   a. Oracle Operation: Apply the phase oracle that marks the target state by flipping its phase\n",
    "   b. Diffusion Operator: Apply the Grover diffusion operator, which consists of:\n",
    "      - Hadamard gates on all qubits\n",
    "      - A conditional phase shift of -1 on all states except $|0\\rangle$\n",
    "      - Hadamard gates on all qubits again\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measurement: Measure the qubits in the computational basis to obtain the solution with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of iterations is typically chosen to be $\\lfloor \\pi/4 \\cdot \\sqrt{N} \\rfloor$ which provides the optimal probability of finding the target state.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Circuit primitives: Diffusion, Polynomial Oracle\n",
    "- Use of the z-register to store state amplitudes midcircuit "
